# ps5bot
ps5 bot that checks BestBuy stock and alerts the user if the ps5 is in stock. The bot then proceeds to checkout and take the user to the order screen.

Example:

The ps5 is currently sold out and out of stock so the bot will continue to refresh the page until "Sold Out" turns to "Add to Cart".

When the ps5 is in stock the bot will make a "bell" noise alerting the user that there is finally ps5's in stock. The bot will add it to the users cart and take them to the sign in screen:

As of now the bot only works well if the user has a BestBuy account. The user must have their information, such as address, full name, credit card #, state, zip code etc. already filled out on their account. 

The user will then be shown the following screen where they will be asked to put their cvv # so they can finally check out and get their ps5 shipped to their house:

Enjoy your PS5!!!!
